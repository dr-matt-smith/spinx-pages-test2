Examples 
============

Each Celbridge release includes an example project that demonstrates the core features of Celbridge. Access this example project as follows: 

1. Launch Celbridge. 
2. From the home menu, click `New example project`.

.. note::
   If an existing project opens instead of the home menu, click the home button in the navigation bar to the left of the explorer panel. 

3. Enter a name for the example project (e.g. "my_examples") and select a location for it. 
4. Celbridge will generate a new example project. Each folder in this project contains an example of a core feature of Celbridge. For example, the `01_markdown` folder demonstrates how to work with Markdown files. 

5. To get started with each feature, see the `readme.md` files contained in the example folders.
