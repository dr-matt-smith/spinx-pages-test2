Installation 
============

Celbridge is distributed as a `.msix` installer for Windows.

.. note::
   Celbridge currently runs on Windows only.

   A macOS version is planned, and Linux/WASM versions may be possible depending on demand.

1. Download and run the latest `.msix` installer from the `downloads page`_ page of the `celbridge.org`_ website. 
2. When prompted, click `Install` (if this is your first time installing the program) or `Update`. 
3. Install the .NET Desktop Runtime if prompted by the installer.  
4. Launch Celbridge from the **Start** menu, if it doesn't launch automatically.

Each release includes an example project that demonstrates the core features of Celbridge. Access this example project as follows: 

1. Launch Celbridge. 
2. From the home menu, click `New example project`.

.. note::
   If an existing project opens instead of the home menu, click the home button in the navigation bar to the left of the explorer panel. 

3. Enter a name for the example project (e.g. "celbridge_examples") and select a location for it. 
4. Celbridge will generate a new example project. Each folder in this project contains an example of a core feature of Celbridge. For example, the `01_markdown` folder demonstrates how to work with Markdown files. 
5. To get started with each feature, see the `readme.md` files contained in the example folders.
